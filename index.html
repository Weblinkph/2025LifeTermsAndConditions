    <h2>2025 Life Terms & Conditions</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Acceptance of Terms</strong></li>
			By waking up each day and engaging in the experience known as “life,” you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. If you do not agree, please consult your dreams or imagination for alternative realities.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Embrace of Challenges</strong><br>
            I agree to face all challenges, setbacks, and moments of uncertainty with courage, understanding that they are essential for my growth and development. I accept that difficulty is not a barrier, but a bridge to my strength.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Commitment to Resilience</strong><br>
            I commit to responding to life’s inevitable hardships with grace, patience, and resilience. I understand that resilience is not the absence of struggle, but the ability to rise each time I fall.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Pursuit of Purpose</strong><br>
            I will seek and live with purpose, aligning my actions, decisions, and intentions with my deepest values and aspirations. I agree to prioritize what truly matters and let go of distractions that no longer serve my highest good.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cultivation of Love and Connection</strong><br>
			I pledge to love deeply—myself, others, and life itself. I accept that relationships, both with others and with myself, are vital for my well-being. I will nurture these connections with empathy, respect, and authenticity.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Learning</strong><br>
            I accept that learning is a lifelong journey, and I commit to being open to new ideas, experiences, and self-discovery. I will approach every day as an opportunity to grow and evolve.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Empowerment through Self-Authoring</strong><br>
            I affirm that I am the author of my own life. I will take ownership of my choices, actions, and mindset. I recognize that I have the power to shape my story, and I choose to write it with intention and confidence.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Optimism in the Face of the Unknown</strong><br>
            I acknowledge that the future may be uncertain, but I agree to approach it with trust and optimism. I accept that uncertainty is a part of life, and I will embrace it with open arms, knowing that each moment holds potential.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Acknowledgement of Imperfection</strong><br>
            I understand that I am imperfect and that perfection is not the goal. I agree to be kind to myself and others, accepting that mistakes are opportunities for learning, not failures to be feared.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Gratitude and Reflection</strong><br>
            I commit to reflecting on my experiences and expressing gratitude for every part of the journey—both the easy and the difficult. I understand that gratitude is a powerful tool for creating peace and joy in my life.
